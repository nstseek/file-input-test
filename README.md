# This project was created to help a colleague

I was asked for an example of file sending from a simple HTML page to a server for learning purposes, using a file size limit and a restriction for file extensions, showing a live thumbnail.

Here we have the back-end on the server.js file, should be run using node, and the front-end in simple HTML/JS/CSS.

To run it, execute "npm install" then "node server.js" being on the root directory. Then, open index.html and you are good to go.
